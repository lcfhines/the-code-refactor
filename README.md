# the-code-refactor
This project is intended to refactor existing code to follow accessibility standards so that the site is optimized for search engines.

## Description

Various changes were made to the existing code to optimize search engines. The source code now contains semantic HTML elements that follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning. 
The image elements contain accessible alt attributes. The heading attributes fall in sequential order and the title element contains a concise and descriptive title. 

Despite the changes to the existing code, the web application's appearance and functionality have not changed as shown in the below screenshot.
